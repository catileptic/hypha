# What's in a name

A hypha (from Ancient Greek, meaning 'web'; pl. hyphae) is a long, branching, filamentous structure of a fungus. In most fungi, hyphae are the main mode of vegetative growth, spreading and interconnecting with other material entities. Its existence happens underground, its manifestations take place above, breaching into and through the other stratifications of the earth. Its sociology is soft, diverse and non-hierarchical, horizontal and friendly, while being invested and undiverted in keeping its filamentous structure solid. Having this vegetable metaphor as a guiding imaginary, HYPHA defines itself as a collective of individuals working toward a better understanding of technology and its deep-seated implication in our socio-political climate. 

# What is the soil where we come to dig our routes?

As we have witnessed a paradigm shift, going from isolated computing clusters to interconnected university computers and later on to the internet as we know it today. We are inclined to stop for a moment and have a look at the fast-paced evolution and trace back the steps accompanied by curiosity, critical thinking, and technical knowledge to understand how this is affecting us, our communities, and everyone else around us.
Starting with our embodied subjectivities, now in the age of continuous information overload, we’re being bombarded with personalized data enforcing filter bubbles, diluting notions of truth until it becomes a feedback loop of opinions, polarizing populations, deracinating communities.
With regard to society, it has become a common practice for companies and state agencies to embed mass surveillance tools in our public infrastructure (such as public spaces or the internet). In the case of companies, using it for profiling users, predictive analytics, and data mining. In the case of governments, besides data collecting on population, it seems there is also an overly of nations states over imposed on the open internet, creating a split in the internet (or what is commonly referred to as splinternet).
Regarding geopolitics, it seems that technology is just another avenue in which nation-states are heavily invested in the militarization of the internet. Considering the internet became the de facto infrastructure for communication, business, banking, et al., an interesting case scenario would be the Stuxnet malware, in which we can see the change from classical to digital warfare: here, a few allied nation-states built malware made to exploit specific zero-days and infect most devices connected to the Internet, but only activate if it detects specific industrial controllers specific to one target, in this case being an Iranian uranium enrichment facility.
Our critical analysis of technology should look at both the structural/systemic and personal aspects in order to better understand how we can use technology in better ways that benefit our communities. We’re also debating and talking about open-source alternatives which are available freely for everyone to use and implement, but there is another complex debate about material inequality between what are the invisible costs of implementing and maintaining such alternatives for ordinary communities and people, versus big technological companies, which can afford the human resources and technical infrastructure to sustain their services.



# Routes are paved with full encounters

The events were not advertised or made public, but rather everyone joined the events based on peer-to-peer invitations. Our intentions were twofold: first was to pin-point what sort of technologies and technological knowledge our existing collectives need and second was to join people into a new group that would like take on this type of work further. In terms of infrastructure, at that point in time we only had access to rosa. We currently don't have a space, but we have hosted our events and meetings at filaret16 - a local diy punk space.
:::



## Saturday, April 9

#### 12:00 – 13:30 – Hello, world!
- gathering with warm tea and coffee to get to meet and know each other

####  13:30 – 14:30 – Lunch
- vegetarian food to accompany our words

#### 14:30 – 16:00 – Local histories against the global design

Short presentations of 10 to 15 minutes that introduces the history and genealogy of the collectives that are part of this project and their relation with/to autonomous networks and self–governed technologies. Invited collectives: varia, feminist hack meetings, constant, lurk, esc, ooooo

What is hypha? – a short presentation on hypha, a digital space initiated by Sergiu Nisioi and Anca Bucur, what is it and what we aim with it.

Meet Rosa! – Rosa is a Raspberry Pi server that will travel to Bucharest, Athens, Graz, and Brussels. When it is not traveling, it can be accessed at this page https://hub.vvvvvvaria.org/rosa/. We will get the chance to meet the server physically and learn how to connect and interact with it.


#### 16:30 – 18:30 – A beginning, a scratch, a breach

During this session we intend to pinpoint the urgent issues of our local collectives and communities, what types of technologies can we adopt to help us organize better, to keep us secured from state or corporate surveillance, and to help us build a safe digital space. Some questions that we’d like to discuss are:

- What is a server and what can we do with it? Which are the reasons for installing a server?
- How can a server become a political intervention into the capitalist global design? What is its potentiality to coagulate a situated activist movement?
- What does it mean to approach software from a decolonial, feminist perspective?
- A collective digital space (as any other space) needs shared work: how many people would like to join hypha and how much energy can we put into learning how to run a server and transform it into a functional tool?

Which of the following self–hosted services could be useful to our communities?

- email / mailing lists / newsletters
- mastodon alternative social medial
- alternative chat (Rocket.Chat)
- collaborative text editor (etherpads)
- online collaborative text editing (similar to google docs)
- file sharing, calendar, colaborative office (word, spreadsheet, presentations) (Libre Office Online / OnlyOffice / Nextcloud)
- forms (LimeSurvey)
- hosting personal websites, project websites
- publishing platform books, leaflets
- videoconferences (jitsi)
- peer2peer video sharing (peertube)

#### 18:30 – Drinks
- drinks to soothe our thoughts

## Sunday, April 10
#### 14:00 – 15:00 – Lunch

#### 15:00 – 17:00 – An Introduction to the Internet(work)
- a crash tutorial, a presentation where we will discuss how the internet currently works, what types of addresses are out there, what is an IP, a port and what is the Domain Name System. A discussion with knowledge sharing: for those of you who know all of this already, it's a chance to collectively share your knowledge with everyone else.

#### 17:30 – 18:30 – Encryption, VPNs, Proxy
- a crash course presentation where we can learn and discuss what these acronyms mean: HTTPS, SSL/TLS, VPN, TOR browser. Some questions that we would want to ask:
- To what degree encryption can protect us from surveillance?
- What VPN provider to choose from? (if any)
- How do we enable encryption and how to navigate the web?
- What is a hash and how to crack passwords?
- What is TOR network and TOR browser?

####  18:30 – Closing remarks / planning for the future




# When branches attach and filaments touch

April, 9 was a nice and warm day, and we decided to go to the park, sit on the grass and talk about our histories. 


At the discussions participated people from the ATNOFS network (Varia, FHM, and Constant) and on our side we had representatives from different local collective projects such as:



- Filaret16 - anarchist diy space in Bucharest that hosted our events
- Cutra  - radical queer-feminist magazine https://cutra.ro/
- Frontul Comun pentru Dreptul la Locuire (Housing Rights Common Front)  - activist group working for housing movement http://frontulcomun.ro/
- Pagini Libere (Free Pages)  - anarchist, decentralized, autonomous and non-hierarchically organized editorial collective https://pagini-libere.ro/en/
- Colectiva Literatura și Feminism (Literature and Feminism Collective) - organizing events and promoting feminist and queer literature https://literaturasifeminism.wordpress.com
:::

The discussions were aimed at providing a mutual exchange between the invitees from Varia, FHM, and Constant and different local representatives from queer, feminist, and leftist activist circles. 
The second day greeted us with lots of rain and tiredness, we continued our discussions and had a few first attempts at introducing several technical topics between each other.

As a result of our discussions, we learned how other collectives use technology to organize better, how can technology be used towards a situated emancipation, debated the needs of different collectives, and some of use self-organized into a group whose aim is to continue this line of work.


## A Continuation



![](https://hub.vvvvvvaria.org/rosa/chapters/HYPHA/4838a058_T8rbMCsrQ3i26PtrxN4jmw.jpg)


- we gathered reccurently for knowledge sharing sessions and movie-watching nights at Filaret16
- we continued the discussions around feminist servers and explored our own energy and our enthusiasm for doing deployment and doing maintenance work
- we discussed what it means to participate in the work needed to deploy and maintain infrastructure, especially when members have varied levels of comfort when it comes to the technical process involved
- talked a lot about secure communications, and about keeping our data out of the hands of Big Corps
- we feel that we need more exploration before we launch into deploying our own online spaces

Our movie nights program so far included the following:

- [Alles ist eins. Ausser der 0.](https://allesisteins.film/) - documentary about the beginnings of the Chaos Computer Club, in Germany
- [Citizenfour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenfour)
- [The Internet's Own Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet%27s_Own_Boy)
- [The Pirate Bay: Away from Keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPB_AFK) - documentary about the founding of the Piray Bay and the lawsuit that ensued


### The Protocol For Planned Disconnect

Is a workshop that emerged from the "After Extractivism" conference organized by the Beriner Gazette in 2022. The description of the protocol, below, is quoted directly from the conference page.


*Technology is not a panacea, but a tool that must be chosen and used strategically.*

*The Protocol for Planned Disconnect is an Open Source technology that can be used by groups or individuals. Its purpose is to provide a learning journey for everyone who wants to reflect on the deeper connection between technology and nature. You are invited to share it in your communities.*

*This also becomes clear when facing the climate catastrophe. Hence, the claim in this context must be two-fold: climate and tech activism. The first has slowly entered public consciousness, but the latter is usually dismissed, as digital technologies are considered “clean.”*

*The high energy consumption of running data centers, manufacturing smartphones, streaming videos, etc. is underestimated and ignored. So, what does it mean to politicize digital technologies in the face of mutually fueling crises without letting their use become part of the problem or even detrimental to its solution?*

# Memories of a haptic encounter (a dispatch)
Athens / 8-11 jun / 2022

First day (9 jun)
In the first part of the day the guests' projects were presented and discussed on the basis of them 
- presented in Greek, then summarized in English or vice versa in fc of the moment. In the q&a section it was similar, the content of the question was repeated in one of the languages. In the second part of the day we talked about fediverse and federated social media networks - differences between these and centralized ones, examples and talked about various practices adopted by the collectives present. At lunch break our hosts took us to a place with good and varied gyros, vegan options etc. and in the evening we also went around the area, I think it was more traditional food and tsipouro.
ATNOFS means A Traversal Network Of Feminist Servers
federated networksrosa - a feminist server set up on a raspberry pifree and open source networkpublishing, decentralised networks, technology, toolsOcto - the physical space hosting our workshops
Project: WordMord - project to amend the legislative code to include femicide in the penal code. The results were that the mainstream media started to use and normalize the explicit use of the term femicide when talking about this crime.
- started in 2016
- language and technology in relation to trauma and violence
                    Is language a wound made of fences?
The tentacles of the project: research, glossaries, lexiconstechnicalperformativetranslationbiological metaphors -virus, tentacle
Results of the day
> a local feminist group in greece would like to make a mastodon instance to connect the people they work with, i.e. victims of domestic violence especially in rural areas, to create an alternative support network. we’ll see how they implement it.



The second day (10 June)
In the first part of the day, also like this, the guests presented their projects and questions were asked - unfortunately there was much less alternation of Greek and English so it was much harder to follow and the topics were a bit more dense and research heavy today. In the afternoon we talked about how different communities relate to feminist hacking initiatives, then we had a speculative exercise in 3 groups with a list of questions, the aim being to think of a possible feminist object/tool/technology that we created. mixed results. In the flow of the meeting something creaked organisationally at this point, due to fatigue but also the uncertainty of the moderator. to take into account the human and inter-human factor in workshops like this and communities, working groups. For lunch we went to a Syrian place, nice, good, tasty. In the evening every where, then a short party of 2h in a municipal square urban revitalized by hipsters, frumi though.
Detailed:
Feminist hacker movements: relationships
hackerspaces and opensource a political initiatives have been indifferent and even hostile
in the southern hemisphere, hacking is an integrated activity of local feminist movements, out of the need to create their own infrastructure
in the developed west, feminist hacking comes from the speculative/theoretical vein: cyberfeminism, linguistics, arts and culture, not necessarily from local activist movements. for this reason the activities of the two fields - feminist tech and activism - are not harmonized. at the edge of the developed west, we are in two waters
reading recommendations from Marthe and gossip:
Considerations of teamwork when the common language is English but no one’s first language; considerations when the mother tongue is the majority of the team but there are others involved and the common language is English (or another hegemonic language): very complicated, important to treat others with care
- reading rec are secret because I didn’t have time to transfer them from paper to digital form
Extra
We also observed the violent gentrification of the anarchist quarters in Athens, this was saddening. Cops in turtle gear (riot gear) everywhere.
Public transport is nice.

# What our local collectives need

## 1. Security
This issue is recurrent in our discussions, even before the first meetings. We are all interested in having a more secure internet, safeguarded from state or corporate monitoring and further to have our local devices secured against any potential attacks.
According to the Romanian dictionary, anarchy is a state of disorganization and disorder, chaos in a country or an institution; indiscipline, disobedience of the individual to an organized collective. Therefore, we can find such terms in our legal apparatus and can become very risky as organizations that identify as anarchist could be used as scapegoats or targeted by the police. Folks still remember the 2008 violent crackdown by the police against a potential anti-nato protest that destroyed the cohesion and put an ent to many local collectives: https://www.statewatch.org/news/2008/april/romania-police-actions-against-anti-nato-protests-in-bucharest/
The more urgent this matter, as the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the War in Ukraine determined a further militarization of the state. At the same time, the policies implemented in Romania tend to undermine and devalue public service and facilitate the outsourcing of essential services such as medical and educational to multinational private entities.

When we wish to communicate securely, we should make a habbit of using Signal to chat and organize our meetings. While this can be blocked, we can be inspired by previous attempts at bypassing censorship, from the Hong Kong protests where peer2peer technologies were used to communicate: (footnote https://www.businessinsider.nl/hong-kong-protesters-tinder-and-apple-airdrop-to-organize-2019-8?international=true&r=US). Similarly, during Arab Spring protests, Raspberry PIs were used to setup mobile localnets for communication.
For browsing we can use the TOR network and run snowflake to help other access the internet safely.
In the end, security is a privilege, especially if we wish to run self-hosted instances. Security involves a full-time commitment and it's not possible at this moment to provide security guarantees to our peers using self-hosted technologies.
What we can provide are workshops and discussions around these topics and means to help people secure their devices and identify whether they might be targeted.

## 2. An Archive
During the meetings, we realized that the documentation from all the recent events, protests or actions is scattered and many times lost amongst our peers. And while we wouldn't want to have a public storage where some unwanted eye could take a look, nor we would want to risk losing everything in a single-point-of-failure-kind of storage, it would still be valuable to have an open digital space where we could back-up or preserve a structured copy of our actions so that we have the ownership of our histories.
Therefore, an archive seems like a valuable resource to have that can be provided as-a-self-hosted-service.
Questions left unanswered:
    
While this sounds great in theory, we were left with plenty of questions at the end, the most important ones being:
    
- how much time and resources are needed for such a thing?
- who has access to this resource?
- a power structure will likely emerge between the hosters and the users; how do we deal with this?
- how do we comply with GDPR or people who wish to have their data deleted?

And maybe the answer to all these is not to offer the archive as a quasi-public service, but to have an encrypted, shared machine, disconnected from the internet that is available in one of our collective spaces.


## 3. Alternatives to social media
Social media is used to promote the work of our collectives. Facebook, in particular, is extremely important in Romania and is the principal medium of planning, inviting and organizing events. Beyond that, facebook is used to connect with people outside of the local bubble, especially with people outside of the main urban centers. While facebook is an extractivist platform gathering information from everyone, even those who aren't logged-in, active or even registered users, it is extremely widespread in Romania which makes it (sadly) one of the best platforms for contacting vulnerable people, especially in cases of violence, housing, or racial injustice.
Access to technological emancipation is limited by class and social context, therefore, in difficult times, we accept the trade-off of using an extractivist platform in order to continue doing our work.
The alternatives to social media would be useful for our collectives to share our thoughts and ideas amongst each other without worrying that some platform would track every single step we take and without being constantly distracted by scrolling through an infinite feed of commercials. More importantly, the alternative social media should have the role of connecting the people that do not live in the same city, since everybody from our groups agreed that we need "less social media" and more "social meetings face-to-face".
The discussions related to social media have been developed further through our participation at the lurk chapter and have been a recurrent topic in our discussions.

Summary:
    
- a mastodon instance would help us get more filtered and concised content, where we don't get bombed by commercials and other facebook-like features
- mainstream social networks are still the only ones that can help us reach a wider audience beyond our bubble
- we need to be aware that once an instance becomes an essential infrastructure for the local communities, we need to take ownership of it and continue providing this service for as long as possible
- we talk about the mental burden associated with switching our processes and our tools
- we also need to come up with a set of guidelines for whom to block and how to moderate, we are excited by the idea of learning how to deploy and moderate and instance
- a self-hosted mastodon instance is not suitable to help our collectives communicate essential organizational content that could make the communities more vulnerable


 

## 4. Digital emancipation
This is another recurrent topic that emerges in our groups. Beyond providing access to private and secure technologies, it is of utmost importance to provide workshops and knowledge sharing sessions with our local groups of interested peers. This implies that both the people who organize the workshop and the ones who participate in these knowledge-sharing sessions have the availability to teach and learn bidirectionally. Availability can mean time availability, openness, an understanding of the burning issues related to technology, an adequate space, and actual digital infrastructure. Furthermore, workshops on digital emancipation must be adapted to different types of audience since addressing a queer feminist audience may require a different approach than an anarchist decentralized collective. Needless to say, the speaker must keep aware of the power relations created during an event and the historical patriarchal sides of technology.
Conclusions:
Unfortunately, synchronizing all these requirements between a workshop organizer and the participants is fairly difficult within the current local context (in Bucharest). The local context is fairly restrictive - spaces that are not business-oriented lack financial support and plenty of us are in a state of precarity which leads to exhaustion and lack of availability for teaching and learning.
The state at which we are now is more than incipient in every aspect. Our current goals are to start small and open these discussions in both formal and informal contexts. Beyond tech knowledge, we wish to create a local vocabulary and to bring a critical perspective inspired by new-materialist and ecofeminist theories. We are aware that this is a kind of work that can only be done with time and must be accompanied by leisure and emotional care.


## 5. Safe and User-friendly Digital Services
This is related to the first point and the need to have privacy and security. Facebook groups are not desirable. There is a need for safe digital services, from chat groups, storage, to shared document writing, but it's also very important to be easy to use. After all, writing a text collaboratively is definitely easier in a google document than in a cryptpad.
To have safe digital services, advocacy and policy changes can be used to impose more legislative control of the extractivist platforms. Self-hosting can't always substitute the technologies everyone's familiar with, and it's more of a path towards learning and working collaboratively and towards sharing a common digital space.
